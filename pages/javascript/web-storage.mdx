# Web Storage Questions

---

This section focuses on web storage topics in JavaScript, including questions related to `cookies`, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage`.

#### 1. What is Web Storage? ⭐

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Answer</strong>
  </summary>
  **Web storage** is an API by which browsers can store some data locally within the user's browser. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.

    1. **Local storage**: It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.
    2. **Session storage**: It stores data for one session and the data is lost whenever the browser tab is closed.

#### 2. What is a `Cookie`?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Answer</strong>
  </summary>
  A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's device by a website, used to remember information like login status or preferences across sessions. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs.
  
  For example, you can create a cookie named username as below,

    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=TusharSurve";
    ```
</details>

#### 3. Why do you need a `Cookie`?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Answer</strong>
  </summary>
  Cookies are needed to store user-specific information, such as login sessions, preferences, and shopping cart items. They help websites provide a personalized experience and maintain continuity across visits.

#### 4. How do you delete a `Cookie`?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Answer</strong>
  </summary>
  To delete a cookie, you can set its `expires` or `max-age` option to a past date or `0`, respectively, using the same name, domain, and path. For example:

  ```javascript
  document.cookie = "cookieName=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
  ```
</details>

#### 5. What are the differences between `cookie`, `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`? ⭐

  Comparison of **Cookie**, **Local Storage**, and **Session Storage**:

  | Feature                 | Cookie                              | Local Storage                       | Session Storage                     |
  |-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
  | **Data Storage Limit**   | 4 KB                               | up to 5 MB                             | up to 5 MB                             |
  | **Expiration**           | Manually set (can expire)           | No expiration (until manually deleted) | Automatically cleared when the tab or browser is closed |
  | **Storage Scope**        | Sent with every HTTP request (if not set as `HttpOnly`) | Only accessible via client-side scripts | Only accessible via client-side scripts |
  | **Accessibility**        | Server and client (if `HttpOnly` is not set) | Client-side only                   | Client-side only                   |
  | **Security**             | Can be made secure using `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags | Less secure (accessible by JavaScript) | Less secure (accessible by JavaScript) |
  | **Use Case**             | Session tracking, authentication    | Long-term storage (user settings)   | Temporary session data             |
</details>

#### 6. What are the methods available on `localStorage`?

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Answer</strong>
  </summary>
  The LocalStorage provided methods for reading, writing and clearing the session data

  - **`setItem(key, value)`**: Stores a key-value pair.
    ```javascript
    localStorage.setItem('name', 'Tushar');
    ```

  - **`getItem(key)`**: Retrieves the value for the specified key.
    ```javascript
    const name = localStorage.getItem('name');
    ```

  - **`removeItem(key)`**: Removes the specified key and its value.
    ```javascript
    localStorage.removeItem('name');
    ```

  - **`clear()`**: Removes all key-value pairs from `localStorage`.
    ```javascript
    localStorage.clear();
    ```
