**Web storage** is an API by which browsers can store some data locally within the user's browser. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.

    1. **Local storage**: It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.
    2. **Session storage**: It stores data for one session and the data is lost whenever the browser tab is closed.
