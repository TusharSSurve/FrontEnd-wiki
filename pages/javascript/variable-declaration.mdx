# Variable Declaration Questions

#### 1. What is the purpose of the `let` keyword? ⭐

    <strong>Answer</strong>

  The `let` keyword in JavaScript declares block-scoped variables, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined. Unlike `var`, `let` does not allow re-declaration in the same block and prevents the use of uninitialized variables. Variables declared with `let` are hoisted but cannot be accessed until their declaration is reached, which prevents the use of uninitialized variables.

    ```javascript
    let value = 20;
    if (value) {
      let value = 31;
      console.log(value); // 31
    }
    console.log(value); // 20
    ```

#### 2. What is the difference between `let` and `var`? ⭐

  Here's a detailed comparison of `let` and `var`:

    | var                                                            | let                                           |

    | Available since the beginning of JavaScript         | Introduced as part of ES6                     |
    | It has function level scope                                    | It has block level scope                      |
    | Variable declaration will be hoisted, initialized as undefined | Variable declaration will be hoisted but not initialized                   |
    | It is possible to re-declare the variable in same scope    | It is not possible to re-declare the variable in same scope |

  Let's take an example to see the difference:

    ```javascript
    function sayHi() {
      console.log(name); // undefined
      console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
      var name = "Tushar";
      let age = 26;
    }
    sayHi();
    ```
