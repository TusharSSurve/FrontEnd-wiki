    <strong>Answer</strong>

  TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language, allowing developers to define data types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch errors at compile time rather than runtime, improving code quality and maintainability.

  Key features of TypeScript include:

  - **Static Typing**: Allows developers to specify types, enhancing code clarity and reducing bugs.
  - **Type Inference**: Automatically infers types when they are not explicitly defined.
  - **Interfaces and Generics**: Supports defining contracts for objects and creating reusable components.
  - **Compatibility with JavaScript**: Any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.
  - **Tooling Support**: Offers features like autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring in modern IDEs.
