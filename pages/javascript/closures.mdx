# Closures Questions

---

Closures are a crucial concept in JavaScript. This section highlights essential questions related to closures.

#### 1. What are Closures? ⭐

    <strong>Answer</strong>
  </summary>
  Closures in JavaScript are a fundamental concept that allows a function to "remembers" it's surrounding lexical variables, even when the function is executed outside that scope. In simpler terms, a closure is created when an inner function is defined within an outer function, enabling the inner function to access variables and parameters of the outer function even after the outer function has finished executing.

  **Example of Closures:**

  ```javascript
  function outerFunction() {
      let outerVariable = 'I am outside!';

      function innerFunction() {
          console.log(outerVariable); // Accessing the outer variable
      }

      return innerFunction; // Returning the inner function
  }

  const closureFunction = outerFunction(); // outerFunction is executed, returning innerFunction
  closureFunction(); // Output: I am outside!
  ```

  **Practical Uses of Closures:**

  - **Data Privacy**: Keeping certain data private from the global scope.
  - **Partial Application**: Creating functions with preset arguments.
  - **Event Handlers**: Maintaining state in asynchronous callbacks.
  - Can be used to implement **Memoization**

  Here are brief potential pitfalls of using closures:

  1. **Memory Leaks**: Closures may unintentionally retain references to variables, preventing garbage collection.  
  2. **Overhead**: Excessive use can lead to increased memory usage and performance issues.  
  3. **Debugging Complexity**: Identifying and resolving issues in closure-heavy code can be challenging.  
  4. **Variable Sharing**: Closures capture references, not values, causing unexpected behavior in loops or asynchronous code.

#### 3. What is memoization? ⭐

    <strong>Answer</strong>

  **Memoization** is an optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  function memoizedMultiply() {
    const cache = {}; // Cache stored in closure
    return function (a, b) {
      const key = `${a},${b}`;
      if (key in cache) return cache[key]; // Return cached result
      cache[key] = a * b;
      return cache[key];
    };
  }

  const multiply = memoizedMultiply();

  console.log(multiply(5, 10)); // 50 (calculated)
  console.log(multiply(5, 10)); // 50 (cache)
  ```

  The `cache` is preserved in the closure, ensuring it persists across function calls.

#### 4. What is the difference between a closure and a higher-order function? 

<details>
  <summary>
    <strong>Answer</strong>
  </summary>
  Here’s a detailed comparison:

  - **Closure**: A function that "remembers" its surrounding scope even after the outer function has executed.

    ```javascript
    function outer() {
      let count = 0;
      return function inner() {
        count++;
        return count;
      };
    }
    const closureExample = outer();
    console.log(closureExample()); // 1
    ```

  - **Higher-Order Function**: A function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.

    ```javascript
    function higherOrder(fn) {
      return function (x) {
        return fn(x) + 1;
      };
    }
    const hofExample = higherOrder((num) => num * 2);
    console.log(hofExample(3)); // 7
    ``` 

  **Key Difference**: Closures deal with retaining state, while higher-order functions focus on passing or returning functions.
