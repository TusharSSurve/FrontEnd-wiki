  JavaScript provides various data types to work. These can be broadly classified into **Primitive** and **Non-Primitive** types.

**Primitive** types are immutable and stored directly in the stack.

- **String**: Represents textual data (a sequence of characters).
  ```js
  let name = "John";
  ```
- **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
  ```js
  let age = 25;
  let score = 99.5;
  ```
- **Boolean**: Represents a logical value: `true` or `false`.
  ```js
  let isLoggedIn = true;
  ```
- **Undefined**: A variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
  ```js
  let x;
  console.log(x); // undefined
  ```
- **Null**: Represents an explicitly empty or non-existent value.

  ```js
  let emptyValue = null;
  ```

- **Symbol**: A unique and immutable value, typically used as object keys.

  ```js
  let uniqueKey = Symbol("key");
  ```

**Non-Primitive** types are mutable

- **Object**: Used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

  ```js
  let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
  };
  ```

- **Array**: A special type of object used for storing ordered collections of values.

  ```js
  let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
  ```
